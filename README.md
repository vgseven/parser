# Parser

Parser is a powerful and efficient Markdown processor designed specifically for handling LLM (Large Language Model) responses. This innovative tool simplifies the formatting and parsing of text generated by LLMs, ensuring a seamless integration into various applications and platforms. With Parser, you can effortlessly transform raw LLM responses into well-structured and visually appealing content.

# Major Update

- Currently Parser is under construction and migrating to turborepo with well structured architecture and documentations.

- Parser will be available in near future, and also I'm thinking to built it in rust..
